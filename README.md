phpBB's Skeleton Extension is a tool for extension authors to help speed up and simplify the task of starting a new extension project. It generates sample starter files and directories in a skeleton package that you can use to begin building your extension.

View the [documentation](https://area51.phpbb.com/docs/dev/3.3.x/extensions/skeleton_extension.html) for installation and usage information.

The Skeleton Extension is available from phpBB.com as an Official Tool [here](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/official_tool/ext_skeleton/).
